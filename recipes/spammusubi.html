        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Spam musubi originated in Hawaii and is a popular meal there because it is cheap and easy to cook</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces spam</li>
            <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>nori roasted seaweed used for seaweed cut into halves or thirds</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Split spam into 8-10 pieces and put in a ziplock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag. Marinate for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Drain off marinade and fry Spam on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or prefered doneness</li>
            <li>Place a strip of nori on a surface and place musubi mold across the middle. Add sushi rice to the mold and press down firmly. Dip the mold and your giners in water as you go to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Remove the mold from the rice. Add the spam to the top and wrap one side of the nori and stick to the spam. Wrap the other side and you are done.</li>
        </ol>
